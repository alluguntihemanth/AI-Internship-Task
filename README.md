# 📚 **AI Internship Task: PDF Processing Pipeline**  

---

## 🌟 **About the Project**  
The Task focuses on creating a **PDF Processing Pipeline** that handles PDF files for summarization and keyword extraction. Designed to efficiently manage PDF documents, this project utilizes custom algorithms and MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

---

## ✨ **Key Features**  
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from various PDF formats.  
- **Custom Summarization**: Generates concise summaries from extracted text.  
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies and retrieves important keywords from the documents.  
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores processed data for easy access and retrieval.  
- **Test Suite**: Includes a set of sample PDFs to validate functionality.

## 🚧 **Development Status**  
This application is currently under active development. As such, it may still contain bugs or incomplete features. User feedback is welcome to help improve the functionality and overall experience.

## 🌐 **Running Locally**  
- The application is designed to run only on a local server environment for the time being. This means you will need to set it up on your own machine to test and interact with the features.
- To run the application, follow the setup instructions provided in the **Run the Application** section.
- Since it's running locally, users won't be able to access it via a public URL; they must have the application installed and run it from their local environment.

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   - Install the required packages:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Launch the Application**  
   - Navigate to the project directory:  
     ```bash
     cd D:/ai-intern-task
     ```
   - Run the main script:  
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## 💬 **How It Works**  
1. **PDF Input**: Users provide PDF files for processing.  
2. **Text Extraction**: The pipeline extracts text from the PDFs.  
3. **Summarization and Keywords**: It generates summaries and extracts keywords from the text.  
4. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in MongoDB for easy retrieval.
